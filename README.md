# Final Project for Linux Embedded Systems and Topics (CU-ECEN-AELD)

This project is the culmination of learning where a complete embedded system
is developed for a specific board.

This project will be creating a <some_type_of_system> on a PandaBoard.

We will determine what else will be accomplished here.
